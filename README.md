# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles designed to work on all of my devices with no individual configurations needed for each device. 

## Requirements

#### Operating System

I do most of my testing on Arch Linux as it has become my daily driver. Slowly I'm trying to make it all less distro-exclusive.

#### Display

This set of dotfiles assumes a display of 3200x1800 or similar HiDPI resolution. For smaller resolutions, go to [the standard dots repo](https://github.com/astrakk/dots)
